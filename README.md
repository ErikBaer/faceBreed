# faceBreed

An Algorithm combining two Convolutional Neural Networks for face-recognition from an provided image and subsequent matching to a specific dog-breed. It was developed in course of the Udacity Nanodegree: Python for Artificial Intelligence.

This code accepts any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
